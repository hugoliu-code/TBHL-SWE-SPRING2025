# Running/Testing Backend

To run the backend, cd into backend directory and run flask with debugging turned on.

# Quick Start (requires pip)
```
cd Backend
pip install flask firebase-admin
flask run --debug
```

Alternatively, you can use a venv to run the code:
```
cd Backend
python -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install flask firebase-admin
source venv/bin/activate # adjust based on your current shell
flask run --debug
```

# Certifications
You may be missing the firebase certification file, contact Hugo so he can send it to you. We can't store it on github because it will be detected as compromised and deleted.
    
Once you get the file, make sure it is named "firebase_cert.json", and put it in the "keys" directory
