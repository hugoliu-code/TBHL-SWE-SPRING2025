Certifications
    You may be missing the firebase certification file, (if not given to you in zip file)
    contact Hugo so he can send it to you. We can't store it on github because
    it will be detected as compromised and deleted.
    
    Once you get the file, make sure it is named "firebase_cert.json", and put
    it in the "keys" directory.

    You may be missing the ChatGPT key, (if not given to you in zip file)
    contact Thomas so he can send it to you. We can't store it on github because
    it will be detected as compromised and deleted.

    Once you get the ChatGPT key, make sure it is stored in a new file called "gptkey.json", 
    and put it in the "keys" directory.
